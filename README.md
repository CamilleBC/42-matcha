## How-to

You should have docker launched (or docker-machine on Windows/Darwin).
Use the `docker-compose up -d` command in the root folder to launch all services (optional `--build` flag if you want to rebuild the Dokerfile images).

Connect to `localhost:8001` to access the server (use `docker-machine env default` on Windows/Darwin to find the machine's IP to connect to).
